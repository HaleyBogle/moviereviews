Title: The Martian
Cast: Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain
Year: 2015
Genre: Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi
Rated: PG-13

Going into this movie it seemed as though it would be another space movie about something going terribly wrong. The movie Gravity
immediately came to mind. While I enjoyed the Gravity movie The Martian blows it out of the water and truly shows the struggle
of being the only human on a planet. Highly recommend seeing it.
