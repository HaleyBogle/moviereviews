Rated: R

Amy is a up and coming comedian that has now added starring/writing a movie to her resume with this romantic comedy. The premise
is that her father taught her growing up that monogamy is not possible and to strive for it is to set yourself up for failure. 
Amy meets a great guy played by Bill Hader and realizes that she wants to be in a real relationship with him. Through self sabotage
and many awkward moments Amy finds it hard to make it work. 

I love this movie because many of the scenes and situations are relatable. Yes it's still a movie so some things have been dramatized
to keep people watching however the overall plot is all to familiar. I haven't LOLed in a movie theatre in a long time until I saw
this recently. Definitely worth watching!
