Title: Oculus
Cast: Karen Gillan, Brenton Thwaites, Katee Sackhoff
Year: 2013
Genre: Horror
Rated: R

In the spirit of Halloween being right around the corner we decided to watch a scary movie. Oculus does a fine job of feeling a 
constant state of suspense followed by the jump off the couch action. The story isn't highly original or intriguing but there is
just enough of the pull to understand to keep you watching. I will definitely give this a thumbs up for endings though, I love
when movies end in a way that surprises you and at the same time you know there was no other appropriate ending.
