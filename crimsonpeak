Title: Crimson Peak
Cast: Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Hunnam
Year: 2015
Genre: Drama, Fantasy, Horror
Rated: R

Crimson Peak was advertised as a Halloween season scary movie to see this year. Going into the movie I expected to be startled,
creeped out, intrigued, and everything else that goes along with a scary movie. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the 
cast. In fact the reason I saw the movie was due in large part to who was starring in the movie. The worst part of the movie for
me was the animation of the ghosts, they looked ridiculous and unrealistically scary. She sees the ghost of her mother and she 
looks like a black skeleton in a cloak. Nothing scary really happened and the resolution felt like it was missing something. 
Overall I would not recommend this movie.
