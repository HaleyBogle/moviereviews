  This movie was a great way too end off a great cartoon, it reminds you of all the cartoon adventures
Ed, Edd and Eddy took us on. This movie took all the mysterys that the series gave us, and that satisfaction
that you get when you complete this movie is well worth its time. This movie is a little bit of everything you could 
think of, it has humor, saddness, trust, and a lot more emotions, over all this movie is worth watching.
