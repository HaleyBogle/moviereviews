Title: Inception
Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy
Year: 2010
Genre: Mystery/ Sci. Fi
Rated: PG-13

Inception is one of those movies that leaves you guessing; you're left in suspense and confusion after each new plot twist. It 
has immense rewatch value. Everytime I've gone to watch it again, I've noticed another little detail, another little puzzle piece
that makes it make so much more sense. However, it's not one of those movies that just confuses you and makes you feel stupid. 
Even if you don't understand how the "dream within a dream" concept works, the story is nice and uplifting in a way. If you want 
to be happy when you finish watching it, I suggest turning it off right before the last three or so minutes.
