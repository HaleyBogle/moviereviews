Oldie but a goodie. I decided to ring in October with a classic festive movie. For such a strange and different movie it sure 
does appeal to a wide range of people. As a kid everyone wished there were really villages for every holiday that we could visit
at any time of the year. The iconic characters of the movie show up every Halloween season and they never get old. The movie is 
a great twist on a holiday film that mixes two worlds in a fun and corky way. Highly recommend if you're one of 9 people that 
hasn't seen it yet.
